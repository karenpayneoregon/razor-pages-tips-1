# Code done wrong and how to fix it

This repository is dedicated to a developer just starting out with Visual Studio on how to write decent code. Many samples come from Karen's twenty plus years helping developers asking questions in online developer forums and by in some cases not responding but make note of these cases.

## Project types

Console and Windows Forms will be dominate project types as they are best to learn from. Why use Windows Forms when there are other project types like MAUI and WPF? Windows Forms when used are glorified console projects in that when performing work a developer can easily see their work and get a better understanding of events, delegates and asynchronous programming.

What about web projects? There will be web projects included from time to time when appropriate.

# Working with databases

All work done with databases will be Microsoft SQL-Server

## Accessing data

Majority of work will be done with Microsoft Entity Framework Core 6 and higher

# Json

Many times `json` will be used either for a quick-n-dirty way to setup data for experimentation along with storing application settings in any project type from console to web.

# NuGet packages

In most cases popular packages will be used along with packages created by Karen Payne.
